# SortMaster

This app is built using React and is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.

This app is deployed with Netlify and can be accessed here: (https://sortmaster-nilesh.netlify.app/).

## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with React and also learn classic sorting algorithms. This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both.
